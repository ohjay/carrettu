### Drive your car
Once you have built your car, you can use it like this.

1. Start the default pilot server. `python scripts/serve.py`
2. Start your car and connect it to the pilot server. `python scripts/drive.py  --remote http://<your_pilot_server_ip>:8887`
3. Go to `<your_pilot_server_ip>:8887` on your phone or computer to start driving your car.
